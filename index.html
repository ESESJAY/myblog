    <h2>I have learnt html and css!</h2>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>Cascading style sheet known as CSS. It is used for designing the appearance of the website. Some function of CSS is modifying the color, size and position of content. There are three type of css style. The first type is is the <strong>Inline Style</strong>. The second type is <strong>Style Element</strong>. The third type is <strong>Link Element/External Style Sheet</strong>. There is also id attribute and class attribute in css to name and identify content.</p>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language known as HTML is where it contains the content and structure of the website. </p>
    <p>I have learnt the different types of semantics. For example the header, nav and many more.</p>
    <h4>Header</h4>
     For header it can be used usually used for navigation or introductory content. header tags are often used in article tags it can contain 1 or more heading tags for example h1 to h6.Commonly used for news content, blog posts or independent content piece.
      <h4>Nav</h4>
      <p>Nav tag is usually for location of the menu links.This is for key navigation elements in the site and NOT for every link in a site.</p>
      <h4>Typography</h4>
      <p>I have also learnt how to use google fonts for my website.</p>

    <h1><u>Week 3</u></h1>
    <h2>I got to learn more CSS, Media queries, flex, and the use of Adobe XD for our website wireframe!</h2>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>Form tag come with action and method. <strong>Action</strong> contains the URL to send form data to. <strong>Method</strong> contains the type of HTTP request. The input tag creates interactive controls.
        The "type" attribute determines the type of input
        Reading Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/inputID
         </p> 
    <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear </li>
        <li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
        <li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
        <li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Media queries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Media Query -
            Used to modify the CSS of a site depending on
            qualities such as viewport size or device type</li>
        <li>@media -
            Applies one or more CSS properties based on the
            result of a media query</li>
        <li>Min-width -
            If the minimum width of the viewport is at least
            the specific width or wider, then the media
            query is true</li>
        <li>Max-width -
            If the maximum width of the viewport is at no
            more than the specified width, or itâ€™s narrower
            then the media query is true</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Positioning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Relative Position -
            Moves elements around relative to
where they would appear on the page. Uses
Nudging boxes around. Think of the offsets as being applied
after the browser finishes laying out
the page. Uses Top, Left, Right, Bottom
properties</li>
        <li>Absolute Position -
            Absolute position elements are placed in relation to a
parent content(browser viewport, or parent element).
The parent is the positioning context. Positions can be modified using positioning offsets,
top, right, bottom, left</li>
        <li>Fixed Position -
            Very similar to absolute EXCEPT the
            coordinate system is relative to the
            entire browser window.
            Fixed elements don't scroll with the
            rest of the page.
            Commonly known as sticky elements.</li>
        <li>Relative Absolute -
            Allows us hook back into the static flow of the page</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <p>The flexbox container is the parent of the flex item.
        The children of the flexbox container can be laid out in horizontal or vertical easily and flex their
        size when the content grows or shrink accordingly</p>
    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <p>Like a blueprint for a site or app's
        layout
        Shows important functionality
        Conveys content types and grouping
        Shows information hierarchy. <strong>WIREFRAMES ARE NOT VISUAL DESIGN, TYPOGRAPHY, ICONOGRAPHY, PHOTOGRAPHY!!</strong></p>

    <h1><u>Week 4</u></h1>
    <h2>In this week i have learned how to use Responsive Images for flexible layouts, better understand flex layouts, Using Git & Github Pages!</h2>
    <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
    <p>We learnt how to scale images size down! <Strong>A common trick is to use a very large image > 1920px width to
        fix the issue of not being able to scale it down!</Strong></p>
    <h3>Github</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learned how to create a new repository.</li>
        <li>Learned how to clone the copy of the repository into my visual studio code project.</li>
        <li>Learned how to push and commit to github page.</li>
        <li>Learned how to publish my repository so other users can see my deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><u>Week 6</u></h1>
    <h2>I got to recap what io have learnt in week 5 and also javascript objects & more!</h2>
    <h3>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
    <p>OOP are Objects group together a set
        of variables and functions to
        create a model of an object in real-life.</p>
        <img src="Images/Object-Oriented-Programming.png" alt="OOP">
    <h3>Let</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>let declarations are not
            hoisted to the top of the
            enclosing block.</li>
        <li>let is block-scoped meaning it
            only exist within the braces it
            is contained in {...}.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <p>The for and while loops are the same concept i have learnt in semester 1 python programming.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1><u>Week 7</u></h1>
    <h2>I got to learn Document Object Model (DOM), Event Handling & Validation and JSON Local Storage!</h2>
    <h3>Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
    <p>Official (Closed) - Non Sensitive
        As a browser loads a webpage,
        it creates a model of that page.
        The model is called a DOM Tree. I have also learned how to locate the node that represents the element i want to work with and the use of its text content, child elements, and attributes.</p>
        <img src="Images/pic_htmltree.gif" alt="OOP">
    <h3>Event Handling & Validation</h3>
    <img src="Images/EH1.png" alt="EH1">
    <img src="Images/EH2.png" alt="EH2">
    <img src="Images/EH3.png" alt="EH3">
    <img src="Images/EH4.png" alt="EH4">
    <h3>Event Validation</h3>
    <p>To validate we must add event handler to the keyUp event,
        add event handler to the blur event,
        add event handler to the submit and many more.</p>
    <h3>JSON Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based
            on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The
            named key is a string.</li>
        <li>The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings,
            Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a
            string.</li>
        <li>If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to
            use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data
            into the expected JavaScript data type.</li>
        <li>Web storage (or HTML5 storage) lets you store data
            in the browser.</li>
        <li>The data it stores can only be accessed by the
            domain that set the data.</li>
        <li>There are two types of storage: <strong>local</strong> and <strong>session</strong>
        <li>They are implemented using the localStorage and
            sessionStorage objects.</li>
        <li>Both local and session storage have the same
            methods to get and set data, but each lasts a
            different amount of time.</li>
    </ul>
